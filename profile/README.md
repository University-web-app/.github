# About organization
This organisation provides the source code for the projects which together form a system for retrieving data from Moodle and can be used by any university that uses Moodle. 

# About repositories
Repositories include a web application that processes data from Moodle, such as grades, deadlines, attendance, courses, and personal data. When data changes, such as grades, it saves the change in MongoDB and sends a message to Kafka for further notification to users' smartphones, and a consumer who reads messages from Kafka and then sends notifications to smartphones using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
